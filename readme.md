# Application Security Tools

Compilation of tools I created to help shorten the amount of work required to find duplicate IP addresses in a list, as well as randomizing lists and splitting them evenly.

## Duplicate_IP_Finder

This application accepts user input, which is expected in the terminal and must conform to the following format

> 1.1.1.1, 2.2.2.2, 3.3.3.3, 4.4.4.4

After the program executes, it will display any duplicates if they are found.

## Randomize_Divide_IP

This application accepts user input, which is expected in the terminal and must conform to the following format

> 1.1.1.1, 2.2.2.2, 3.3.3.3, 4.4.4.4

After the program executes, it will display **3** different lists, which have been randomized and evenly divided.
